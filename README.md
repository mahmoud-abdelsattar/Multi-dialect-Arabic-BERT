### About our Multi-dialect-Arabic-BERT model
Instead of training the Multi-dialect Arabic BERT model from scratch, we initialized the weights of the model using [Arabic-BERT](https://github.com/alisafaya/Arabic-BERT) and trained it on 10M arabic tweets from the unlabled data of [The Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification (NADI) shared task](https://sites.google.com/view/nadi-shared-task).
